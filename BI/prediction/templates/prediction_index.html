    <p class="lead">This prediction uses the SVR Model.</p>
    <p class="lead">SVR (Support Vector Regression) is a regression algorithm based on the same algorithms used by Support Vector Machines (SVM) to create classification models. Although there are some differences because the output of a regression is a real value and not a label. Which makes it very difficult to predict objective values. In the case of a regression there are infinite possibilities, compared to the limited number existing in classification problems.</p>

    <p class="lead">In the next <a href="https://chartjs.org">chart</a> you can visualize the original data with the predictions of the SVR Model</p>
    <p class="lead">The prediction has five months limit. This limitations is caused by computation level and variables</p>
