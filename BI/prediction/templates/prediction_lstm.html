        Prediction with Long-Short Time Memory Neural Network

    <p class="lead">
        Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural
        network (RNN) implemented in TensorFlow, are designed to effectively
        capture long-range dependencies in sequential data. LSTMs are equipped
        with memory cells that maintain information over time and specialized
        gates that regulate the flow of information, making them particularly
        well-suited for tasks such as time series forecasting, natural language
        processing, and speech recognition. By addressing the vanishing gradient
        problem common in standard RNNs, LSTMs can learn patterns in data
        sequences that span long intervals, thus improving the model's
        predictive performance in complex scenarios. For more in-depth
        information, you can refer to the [TensorFlow LSTM
        documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM).
